# Purpose of my application
The purpose of my application is to provide users with a convenient and interactive way to view the evening menu of my restaurant. With this app, guests can explore a wide range of culinary options right from their smartphones, making it easy to decide what to order before they arrive. The application not only showcases the evening offerings but also highlights any special dishes, seasonal ingredients, and chef’s recommendations, giving users a taste of what to expect. Additionally, it features enticing photos of each dish, enhancing the overall dining experience and helping users make informed choices. Users can also receive updates about daily specials or limited-time menu items, ensuring they never miss out on unique dining opportunities. By simplifying the menu browsing process, this application aims to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline the ordering process, and ultimately create a more enjoyable and personalized dining experience at my restaurant. The application aso allows the chef to log in and change the menu whener he desires.
# Design consedirations
The home page of the application is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, prominently featuring the restaurant’s logo at the top to establish brand identity. Below the logo, four buttons provide easy navigation for users. The first button, labeled “Starters,” directs users to an enticing selection of starter dishes available for the evening. The second button, “Mains,” takes them to the heartier main course options, while the third button, “Desserts,” leads to a delightful array of sweet treats to conclude their meal. 
The fourth button is specifically for the chef, offering a streamlined way for them to manage the menu. Upon clicking this button, the chef is directed to a secure login page where they can enter their credentials. Once logged in, the chef gains access to a user-friendly interface where they can upload images of their dishes, input names and descriptions, and set prices. Additionally, three intuitive buttons allow the chef to easily remove existing items from the starters, mains, or desserts categories, enabling real-time updates to the evening menu. This ensures that the menu remains fresh, dynamic, and reflective of the chef's latest culinary creations.
# utilisation of github and github actions
To make sure my code works on more platforms than just my local machine, I'll be using GitHub Actions to expedite the testing process. Through the use of GitHub Actions, I want to confirm that the program runs without a hitch on my PC as well as a variety of other computers, including mobile devices. Furthermore, GitHub is a great resource for preserving the application's dependability and guaranteeing a positive user experience. It fosters continuous improvement by offering a collaborative area where problems can be recorded, defects can be reported, and upgrades can be offered. Furthermore, GitHub will be essential in providing thorough reports that outline the application's goals and features. These reports will elucidate the application's objectives, features, and implementation procedures, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding for both developers and end-users alike. Through GitHub's robust capabilities, I aim to enhance the reliability, usability, and transparency of the application, ultimately enriching the overall development and user experience.
